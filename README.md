# sc-error-rate
Implementation of the pipeline measuring transcription error in single cell RNA-seq data.

# Setup
Install the requirements by ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. You can also install the ```sc-error-rate``` 
itself as a python package (in editable mode) by ```pip install -e .```. This is not necessary, but it 
will ensure that ```sc-error-rate``` is always on the PYTHONPATH and that you can import from it.
